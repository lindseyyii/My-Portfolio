      <h3>Orbit</h3>
      <img src="orbit.png">
      <p>This piece showcases a man and a woman in space as if in a dance with celestial bodies. "Orbit" was created using Procreate, drawn from my iPad. The creation process involved combining it with a poetic narrative (accredited to another student) that discusses the otherworldly feel, along with a blend of Adobe Photoshop and InDesign.</p>

      <h3>Remember?</h3>
      <img src="remember.png">
      <p>"Remember?" is an evocative piece that delves into the themes of memory and identity. Utilizing Procreate, Photoshop, and InDesign, this artwork juxtaposes the image of an individual in a red outfit with fragmented text, creating a compelling interplay between image and word that echoes the confusion and loss associated with memory deterioration.</p>
