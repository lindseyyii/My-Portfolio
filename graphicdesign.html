      <h3>Design: Orbit (2022)<br>Art: galaxy (2022)</h3>
      <img src="orbit.png" height="500"/>
      <p>"Orbit" was a holistic effort of my skills in digital illustration and graphic design. The artwork, illustrated in Procreate, was an inspiration of two things: "The Creation of Adam" and the beauty/vastness of the universe. The concept begins with two central figures adrift in an endless starry cosmos, reflecting the sense of isolation in the overwhelming scale of the universe. The design process involved integrating this artwork with a poem (accredited to another student) that discusses existential wandering and inevitability. The typography, modern sans-serif, was selected to complement the theme of a futuristic feel, and the placement of the text was intentionally arranged to guide the viewer's eye fluidly through both a visual and written narrative. Overall, I aimed to create a clean and coherent design and emphasize a theme of the beauty in solitude.</p>

      <h3>Design: Remember? (2022)<br>Art: unfamiliar face (2022)</h3>
      <img src="remember.png" height="500"/>
      <p>For this artwork spread "Remember?", I focused on capturing the struggles of memory loss. Utilizing Procreate, I drew a husband and wife's portrait- but without heads. By removing the faces, their identity was stripped; the faceless people are now blank canvases. I made this artistic decision to underscore the helplessness and heart-wrenching struggle of those who suffer from mental conditions. Then using Photoshop and InDesign, I filtered the image to be red and placed a vibrant yellow shadow. The deliberate combination of these vivid colors was meant to create a staggering and overwhelming visual atmosphere. In addition to manipuating the hues, I manipuated the text by repeating the title "Remember?" and fragmenting each verse. This layout was a not only a creative challenge but an emotional exploration into dementia and the "memories lost to the empty void".</p>

      <h3>Design: Sound (2022)<br>Art: Dancing with the Stars (2021)</h3>
      <img src="dancing with the stars.png" height="500"/>
      <p>A This artwork "Dancing with the Stars," is a tribute to my literary teacher, Mrs. Pope. Her love for her daughter and her daughter's passion in ballet inspired me to draw this piece. With Procreate, I painted a ballerina with perfect form and posture, evoking a feeling of reaching beyond and striving to be great; my aim was to portray how beautiful it is to find one's passion. To enhance the main artwork, I created a backdrop for the text, containing ethereal elements like clouds, bursts of light, feathers, and snow. This was essential to tie seamlessly with with the text "Sound" and create cohesiveness in the final design. The overall layout, therefore, serves not just as recognition to ballet, but a story, allowing the audience to explore the relationship between passion, elegance, and human expression. </p>

      <h3>Concrete (2022)</h3>
      <img src="cover.png" height="500"/>
      <p>The "Concrete" literary arts magazine cover is a painting (drawn in Procreate) inspired by the film "Perfect Blue" and designed as a movie poster. It was drawn according to the philosopy: "Being confined to the things only bringing status or wealth to our lives, our aspirations often stay abstract, existing in thought only, and wanted, but not able to be conceived. However, opportunities to break free exist, changes to embed yourself in the cracks of the cement. And it is only when creative feelings have been bottled up for so long that they can produce the most heartfelt pieces, ones that are most concrete of all." With this, I decided to portray the main character holding a vivid blue rose, with her image fractured in the glass and a tear falling down her face in the shattered reflections. This was an attempt to capture the themes of "breaking free" suggested in both "Perfect Blue" and the philosophy. After being illustrated, I utilized the typography and the tools in Adobe Photoshop to create clean bold letters and a classic color scheme, which helped to create a noir/thriller aesthetic. I intended to set the tone for the magazine aims to explore, inviting the viewer into a world of complex and mysterious yet creative narratives. </p>

      <h3>Cracked (2020)</h3>
      <img src="Cracked.jpeg" height="500"/>
      <p>This digital artwork, "Cracked," rendered in Adobe Photoshop, was intended to explore our internal struggles versus the facade we show the world. The cracks are a metaphor of our inner turmoils, and the cigarette is a take on our fleeting attempts to find happiness in temporary pleasures. Through creating "Cracked," my focus was on emphasizing texture and contrast. I aimed to meticulously detail each feature, especially through the figure's glossy eyes and cracked skin, in order to create a sort of intimacy with the viewer. In doing so, I hope to challenge the viewers to consider how outward appearances can hide the battles we all face and provoke thought on personal resilience and vulnerability</p>

      <h3>Concrete (2021)</h3>
      <img src="Concrete.png" height="500"/>
      <p>"Concrete Angel" was meant to capture the stoic beauty of an angel holding a vibrant red rose- a symbol that represents love and life admist the overwhelming misery. I wanted to bring stark contrast to the artwork and portray the feeling of grief. Using Adobe Photoshop, I painted the angel in grayscale to convey her timeless and ethereal nature, marred by a subtle hint of sorrowness in the remaining part of her that is "alive". This piece, for me, was not only a study of highlights and shadows, but also an exploration into the fragility of existence and the inevitable passage of time.</p>

      <h3>blood red (2021)</h3>
      <img src="blood red.png" height="500"/>
      <p>This piece, drawn in Procreate, is a conceptual portrait named "blood red" and was meant to explore themes of losing of perspective and sight of identity. A central element of this theme is the bold red stripe concealing her eyes. I intended to it to drip down and resemble blood to suggest the pain of being misunderstood or misjudged in such a clouded world. The muted, minimalist background is a repetition of the red stripe, contributing to the idea of an obscured reality all around us. Creating this artwork was a deeply introspective process, and I wanted to challenge my own understanding of perspective and identity.</p>

      <h3>Perfect Blue (2023)</h3>
      <img src="Perfect Blue.jpg" height="500"/>
      <p>This movie poster, drawn in Procreate, is a homage to the animated psychological thriller "Perfect Blue." Designed in a minimalist style with a monochromatic red palette, I intended to capture the complex and fragmented nature of the filmâ€™s protagonist, Mima Kirigoe. Her delicate hand posture, her iconic red dress, the drips of blood, her haunting blank stare- all this combined was to evoke a sense of unease and suspense that mirrors the same nuances in the film. This poster is an exploration of the dark sides of celebrity life and my tribute to a film that significantly impacted the psychological thriller genre.</p>
