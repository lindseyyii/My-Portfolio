      <h3>Design: Orbit (2022)<br>Art: galaxy (2022)</h3>
      <img src="orbit.png" height="500"/>
      <p>"Orbit" was a holistic effort of my skills in digital illustration and graphic design. The artwork, illustrated in Procreate, was an inspiration of two things: "The Creation of Adam" and the beauty/vastness of the universe. The concept begins with two central figures adrift in an endless starry cosmos, reflecting the sense of isolation in the overwhelming scale of the universe. The design process involved integrating this artwork with a poem (accredited to another student) that discusses existential wandering and inevitability. The typography, modern sans-serif, was selected to complement the theme of a futuristic feel, and the placement of the text was intentionally arranged to guide the viewer's eye fluidly through both a visual and written narrative. Overall, I aimed to create a clean and coherent design and emphasize a theme of the beauty in solitude.</p>

      <h3>Design: Remember? (2022)<br>Art: unfamiliar face (2022)</h3>
      <img src="remember.png" height="500"/>
      <p>"Remember?" is an evocative piece that delves into the themes of memory and identity. Utilizing Procreate, I drew a scene of a husband and wife's portrait. Then using Photoshop and InDesign, I filtered the image to be red and added fragmented text, creating a compelling interplay between image and words.</p>

      <h3>Design: Sound (2022)<br>Art: Dancing with the Stars (2021)</h3>
      <img src="dancing with the stars.png" height="500"/>
      <p>A tender and atmospheric piece, "Dancing with the Stars" is a tribute to the grace of ballet and the inspiring impact of my literature teacher, Mrs. Pope. Along with the main piece, I used a variety of programs to create ethereal elements like clouds and feathers that complement the accompanying text.</p>

      <h3>Concrete (2022)</h3>
      <img src="cover.png" height="500"/>
      <p>The "Concrete" literary arts magazine cover features a striking illustration inspired by the film "Perfect Blue," showcasing a character with a vivid blue rose, her image fractured as if through broken glass. The bold composition, drawn on Procreate and polished in Photoshop, creates an impactful visual narrative for the edition it represents.</p>

      <h3>Cracked (2020)</h3>
      <img src="Cracked.jpeg" height="500"/>
      <p>This digital artwork, "Cracked," rendered in Adobe Photoshop, was intended to explore our internal struggles versus the facade we show the world. The cracks are a metaphor of our inner turmoils, and the cigarette is a take on our fleeting attempts to find happiness in temporary pleasures. Through creating "Cracked," my focus was on emphasizing texture and contrast. I aimed to meticulously detail each feature, especially through the figure's glossy eyes and cracked skin, in order to create a sort of intimacy with the viewer. In doing so, I hope to challenge the viewers to consider how outward appearances can hide the battles we all face and provoke thought on personal resilience and vulnerability</p>

      <h3>Concrete (2021)</h3>
      <img src="Concrete.png" height="500"/>
      <p>"Concrete Angel" was meant to capture the stoic beauty of an angel holding a vibrant red rose- a symbol that represents love and life admist the overwhelming misery. I wanted to bring stark contrast to the artwork and portray the feeling of grief. Using Adobe Photoshop, I painted the angel in grayscale to convey her timeless and ethereal nature, marred by a subtle hint of sorrowness in the remaining part of her that is "alive". This piece, for me, was not only a study of highlights and shadows, but also an exploration into the fragility of existence and the inevitable passage of time.</p>

      <h3>blood red (2021)</h3>
      <img src="blood red.png" height="500"/>
      <p>This piece, drawn in Procreate, is a conceptual portrait named "blood red" and was meant to explore themes of losing of perspective and sight of identity. A central element of this theme is the bold red stripe concealing her eyes. I intended to it to drip down and resemble blood to suggest the pain of being misunderstood or misjudged in such a clouded world. The muted, minimalist background is a repetition of the red stripe, contributing to the idea of an obscured reality all around us. Creating this artwork was a deeply introspective process, and I wanted to challenge my own understanding of perspective and identity.</p>

      <h3>Perfect Blue (2023)</h3>
      <img src="Perfect Blue.jpg" height="500"/>
      <p>This movie poster, drawn in Procreate, is a homage to the animated psychological thriller "Perfect Blue." Designed in a minimalist style with a monochromatic red palette, I intended to capture the complex and fragmented nature of the filmâ€™s protagonist, Mima Kirigoe. Her delicate hand posture, her iconic red dress, the drips of blood, her haunting blank stare- all this combined was to evoke a sense of unease and suspense that mirrors the same nuances in the film. This poster is an exploration of the dark sides of celebrity life and my tribute to a film that significantly impacted the psychological thriller genre.</p>
